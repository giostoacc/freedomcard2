          <p>Legacy cards gamify spending to make you spend more instead of save more and trick you with reward programs that are not nearly worth it when you account for how much more you spent on near-term gratification than on long-term goals. Hoyva Card is engineered in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p>Budgets usually warn you after the damage. We set intelligent guardrails the moment you tap and keep you conscious of every marketing ploy so each euro stays loyal to your plan—starting with a few candid answers in the scorecard.</p>

          <p>When a tap conflicts with your plan, Hoyva Card doesn’t just say “no.” It suggests replacements—cheaper cafés, calmer delivery schedules, healthier markets—so you can redirect money into the fund that matters most.</p>
