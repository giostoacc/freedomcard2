        <p>Freedom Card is built by a small EU-based team obsessed with helping people keep more of what they earn.</p>
        <p>The scorecard distills the patterns we see again and again in how people set goals, spend day-to-day, and react to marketing pressure.</p>
        <p>You answer a few honest questions, and we surface the friction points that are easiest to fix first.</p>

          <h2>Legacy cards gamify spending. Freedom Card enforces your future.</h2>
          <p>Legacy cards gamify spending to make you spend more instead of save more and trick you with reward programs that are not nearly worth it when you account for how much more you spent on near-term gratification than on long-term goals. Freedom Card is engineered in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p>Budgets usually warn you after the damage. We set intelligent guardrails the moment you tap and keep you conscious of every marketing ploy so each euro stays loyal to your plan—starting with a few candid answers in the scorecard.</p>
          <ul class="diff-list">
            <li>Automatic allocation locks away savings before discretionary spending</li>

            <summary>Is Freedom Card a bank?</summary>
            <p>No. Freedom Card partners with regulated EU banking providers so you can keep your existing account. We focus on proactive goal enforcement layered on top of your current setup, while your deposits remain safeguarded by the statutory guarantees of those EU banks.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>How do you protect my data?</summary>
            <p>We are GDPR-first: minimal data collection, encryption at rest, granular consent controls, and an always-on data deletion request inside the app.</p>
          </details>
