            <summary>Is Freedom Card a bank?</summary>
            <p>No. Freedom Card partners with regulated EU banking providers so you can keep your existing account. We focus on proactive goal enforcement layered on top of your current setup, while your deposits remain safeguarded by the statutory guarantees of those EU banks.</p>

            <summary>How do you protect my data?</summary>
            <p>We are GDPR-first: minimal data collection, encryption at rest, granular consent controls, and an always-on data deletion request inside the app.</p>
